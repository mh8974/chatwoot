# Chatwoot Railway Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a simplified approach to deploying Chatwoot on Railway without using Docker, which has been causing build failures.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push this code to your Railway project repository**

2. **Configure Railway deployment**
   - Set the start command to: `node railway-server.js`
   - Make sure the PORT environment variable is set by Railway automatically

3. **Create the public directory**
   - Run: `mkdir -p public`
   - Create a simple index.html file in the public directory

4. **Deploy the application**
   - Railway will automatically deploy your app when you push changes
   - The Express server will serve static files from the public directory

## Troubleshooting

If Railway is still serving an old version:

1. **Clear Railway's build cache**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Find the option to clear build cache
   - Redeploy the application

2. **Force a fresh deployment**
   - Make a small change to railway-server.js (like adding a comment)
   - Commit and push the change
   - This should trigger a fresh deployment

3. **Check Railway logs**
   - Examine deployment logs for any errors
   - Make sure the server is starting correctly
